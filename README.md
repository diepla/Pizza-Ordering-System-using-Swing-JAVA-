# Pizza-Ordering-System-using-Swing-JAVA

Following along a Youtube tutorial on how to work with Swing in Java using Eclipse IDE to create a pizza ordering system
The Youtube tutorial link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-F37QqzDUM&t=832s

I made a minor change to the logic of the code so that it calculates the subtotal correctly in the subtotal() function
Through the tutorial, here something that I learn:
- JLabel as well as how to triggle the label to display information as we like
- JCombobox
- JCheckBox
- JRadioButton as well as how to group radio buttons together so that we can choose one selection out of all choices
- ImageIcon
- JButton
- JTextArea
